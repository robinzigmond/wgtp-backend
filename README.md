This is a very simple backend for my [which-game-to-play](https://github.com/robinzigmond/which-game-to-play) app. It consists of a very simple wrapper for the parts of the Boardgamegeek API that I need (responding with JSON rather than the original XML), using Flask and the [Python interface](https://github.com/lcosmin/boardgamegeek) for the BGG API.

It now uses Redis queue and a worker dyno to handle the API requests in a background thread - because for larger collections some requests could not complete in the 30 seconds that Heroku allows (this is not configurable). I've followed closely the method (and code) described in the Heroku docs [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/background-jobs-queueing) and [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-rq) - the main request endpoints now simply add a task to the queue and return JSON giving only the job ID. Then the frontend polls the appropriate `/result/` endpoint using that key until it is ready to return the actual data.
